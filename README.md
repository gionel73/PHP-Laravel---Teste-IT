# PHP-Laravel---Teste-IT

IT Tests is an MVC pattern application created in PHP-LARAVEL framework.

Users log in with a user and password, stored in a Mysql database, where the previous test results of the user are kept, so the student's evolution can be traced.

IT Testing offers the ability to test knowledge for 3 different domains ~ HTML - CSS - PHP ~ with separate queries.
For each domain, a list of questions is displayed, and the user can choose the answer from the variants displayed.
At the end of the test, the user receives a test evaluation and a comparison with the last result.
All student responses and evolutions are saved in Mysql database.
